Notes

## Reasons for demerits

Manual demerit

Blocked user

Cancelled user


## Actions to potentially take

Block user

Delete user

Block IP


## Settings for demerits

Number of points for each of manual demerit, blocked user, cancelled user





Do we want to provide Rules integrations? Possibly add said integrations to other modules like IP Blocking (action: block IP)

And/or to IP demerits: conditions based on number of demerits, actions to block or delete users, actions to block IP addresses.


Things to view in user IP tab provided by IP module

IP addresses used (the original View)

All demerits for this user

All demerits for IP addresses used by this user

Total demerits



Tables for all:

All users, ordered by total demerit weight

All IP addresses, ordered by total demerit weight

All demerits, ordered by date

Also a page for a specified IP address that lists all demerits and users for the IP address


Can we do these with Views to make them click-sortable and editable tables?

Perhaps: separate tables for total values that can be joined via Relationship, e.g.:

table: ip_demerits_ip_totals
fields: ip, points

table: ip_demerits_uid_totals
fields: uid, points

These tables get updated each time we add (or remove) a demerit
